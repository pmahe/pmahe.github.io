Welcome to my homepage !<br><br>

I work at <a href="https://www.biomerieux.fr/">bioMérieux</a> within the <a href="https://gitlab.com/biomerieux-data-science">Data Science department</a>, and I am also a part-time associate professor at the <a href="https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/">University of Grenoble Alpes</a>.<br><br>


I have a broad interest in applying machine learning algorithms to biological data. Over the last decade, I have mainly be involved in clinical microbiology applications, like identifying a bacteria or predicting its antibiotic resistance profile from various technologies (e.g., mass-spectrometry, imaging and next-generation sequencing). I am currently particularly interested in analyzing next-generation sequencing data using k-mer based and/or deep-learning approaches.<br><br>
